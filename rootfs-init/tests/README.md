# `rootfs-init/tests/`

Host-runnable smoke tests for the `forkd-agent.py` bridge — exercises
the recipe-level eval routing (e.g. the playwright-browser recipe's
JS-via-Node path) without needing a real Firecracker round-trip.

## Files

- `fake-warmup.py` — minimal warmup process that speaks the
  bridge protocol (line-JSON over stdin/stdout). Sends
  `{"ready": true}` then echoes any `{"id", "code"}` request back as
  `{"id", "result": "echoed: <code>"}`. Reference implementation of
  the protocol that `recipes/playwright-browser/build.sh` installs
  as `/opt/forkd-warmup.js`.
- `smoke-test.sh` — runs the agent against the fake warmup on the
  host, sends a `ping` + an `eval` action over TCP, prints the
  responses. Verifies the agent's bridge plumbing end-to-end.
- `smoke-sdk.py` — exercises `Sandbox.eval()`'s result_json path
  with stubbed responses. Verifies the SDK deserialises native
  Python objects from Node-recipe replies and still returns repr
  strings for legacy Python-recipe replies.

## Run

```bash
# Bridge smoke (agent + fake warmup, requires nc + Python 3 + a free port 8888):
scp forkd-agent.py tests/fake-warmup.py tests/smoke-test.sh dev-box:/tmp/
ssh dev-box "bash /tmp/smoke-test.sh"

# SDK smoke (host-only):
python3 rootfs-init/tests/smoke-sdk.py
```

Expected output of `smoke-test.sh`:

```
agent_lang: "node", warmup_ready: true        ← ping response
result_json: "\"echoed: ...\""                 ← eval routed via bridge
```

Neither smoke test is wired into CI yet — they're tools for verifying
the bridge while iterating on `forkd-agent.py` or a new recipe.
